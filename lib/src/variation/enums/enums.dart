/// This file exports all the enumeration classes related to product variations
/// in the WooCommerce Flutter API package.
///
/// ## Exported Enums

/// status, stock status, and other properties. No variation-specific enums
/// are defined at this time.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:woocommerce_flutter_api/src/variation/enums/enums.dart';
///
/// // Note: Variation-specific enums will be added here as needed
/// ```
