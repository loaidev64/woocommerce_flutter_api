# WooCommerce Flutter API

A comprehensive Flutter package for seamless WooCommerce integration. Easily manage authentication, notifications, cart, and product data with updated dependencies and full documentation.

## Dependencies

This package leverages the following dependencies:

- [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) (^5.4.1) for HTTP requests
- [faker](https://pub.dev/packages/faker) (^2.1.0) for generating fake data during development
- [flutter_secure_storage](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage) (^9.0.0) for secure data storage
- [pretty_dio_logger](https://pub.dev/packages/pretty_dio_logger) (^1.3.1) for logging HTTP requests in a readable format

## Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
flutter pub add woocommerce_flutter_api
```

## Usage

Create the main WooCommerce object to access all the features of the package:

```dart
final woocommerce = WooCommerce(
  baseUrl: '<woocommerce-url>', 
  username: '<username>', 
  password: '<password>', 
  useFaker: true,
  isDebug: true, // true by default
  apiPath: '<some-custom-path>',
);
```
### Using Fake Data (`useFaker`)

The `useFaker` property is designed for development and testing purposes. When set to `true`, all API requests will return fake data generated by the [faker](https://pub.dev/packages/faker) package. This is especially useful if your WooCommerce backend is still under development—allowing you to build and test your application without relying on live data. Once your backend is ready, simply set `useFaker` to `false` to receive real data.

Example of initializing with fake data enabled:

```dart
final woocommerce = WooCommerce(
  baseUrl: '<woocommerce-url>', 
  username: '<username>', 
  password: '<password>', 
  useFaker: true,
  isDebug: true, // true by default
  apiPath: '<some-custom-path>',
);
```

In this mode, every API call (e.g., authentication, notifications, cart, products) will return simulated responses, allowing you to continue development seamlessly until your WooCommerce backend is published.

### Authentication

Login and securely store the user ID:

```dart
try {
  await woocommerce.login('<email>', '<password>');
  // Login successful, user ID is stored securely
} catch (e) {
  // Handle login error
  print('Login failed: $e');
}
```

### Notifications

Fetch all notifications for the currently logged in user:

```dart
try {
  final notifications = await woocommerce.getNotifications();
  // Process the list of notifications
  notifications.forEach((notification) {
    print('Notification: ${notification.message}'); 
  });
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error fetching notifications
  print('Error fetching notifications: $e');
}
```

### Cart

Retrieve the cart for the current user:

```dart
try {
  final cart = await woocommerce.getCart();
  // Process cart data
  print('Cart Total: ${cart.totals?.totalPrice}');
  cart.items?.forEach((item) {
    print('Item: ${item.name}, Quantity: ${item.quantity}');
  });
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error fetching cart
  print('Error fetching cart: $e');
}
```

### WooCommerce API

#### Fetching a List of Products

Retrieve a paginated list of products with various filtering options:

```dart
try {
  // Fetch the first 10 published products, ordered by title ascending
  final products = await woocommerce.getProducts(
    perPage: 10,
    page: 1,
    status: WooFilterStatus.publish,
    orderBy: WooSortOrderBy.title,
    order: WooSortOrder.asc,
  );
  // Process the list of products
  products.forEach((product) {
    print('Product: ${product.name} - Price: ${product.price}');
  });
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error fetching products
  print('Error fetching products: $e');
}
```

#### Fetching a Single Product by ID

Retrieve details for a specific product using its ID:

```dart
try {
  final productId = 123; // Replace with the actual product ID
  final product = await woocommerce.getProduct(productId);
  // Process the product details
  print('Fetched Product: ${product.name}');
  print('Description: ${product.description}');
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error fetching single product
  print('Error fetching product $productId: $e');
}
```

#### Fetching Products with Related Data (`getProductWithOptions`)

Often, when displaying a product detail screen, you need not only the main product data but also related information like variations, upsells, cross-sells, or grouped products. Making separate API calls for each of these can be inefficient.

The `getProductWithOptions` method solves this by fetching the main product *and* specified related products in a single, optimized request.

**When to Use:**

Use this method typically on a product detail screen. After a user navigates from a product list (where you might have used `getProducts`) to view a specific item, call `getProductWithOptions` to gather all necessary data for that view efficiently.

**How it Works:**

You provide an already fetched `WooProduct` object and a list of `WooProductFilterWithType` enums specifying which related data you need (e.g., `variations`, `upsellIds`, `relatedIds`). The method returns a `WooProductWithChildrens` object containing the `mainProduct` and lists of the requested related products.

**Example:**

Assume you have a `selectedProduct` object (fetched previously) and you want to display its details along with its variations and upsell products.

```dart
// Assuming 'selectedProduct' is a WooProduct object you already have
// and 'woocommerce' is your initialized WooCommerce instance.

try {
  // Specify the related data types you need
  final optionsToFetch = [
    WooProductFilterWithType.variations, // Fetch product variations
    WooProductFilterWithType.upsellIds,  // Fetch upsell products
    WooProductFilterWithType.relatedIds, // Fetch related products
  ];

  final productWithDetails = await woocommerce.getProductWithOptions(
    selectedProduct,
    optionsToFetch,
  );

  // Now you can access the main product and the fetched related data
  print('Main Product: ${productWithDetails.mainProduct.name}');

  if (productWithDetails.variations != null && productWithDetails.variations!.isNotEmpty) {
    print('--- Variations ---');
    productWithDetails.variations!.forEach((variation) {
      print('Variation: ${variation.name} - Price: ${variation.price}');
      // Display variation attributes, price, etc.
    });
  }

  if (productWithDetails.upsellProducts != null && productWithDetails.upsellProducts!.isNotEmpty) {
    print('--- Upsell Products ---');
    productWithDetails.upsellProducts!.forEach((upsell) {
      print('Upsell: ${upsell.name}');
      // Display upsell products (e.g., in a carousel)
    });
  }
  
  if (productWithDetails.relatedProducts != null && productWithDetails.relatedProducts!.isNotEmpty) {
    print('--- Related Products ---');
    productWithDetails.relatedProducts!.forEach((related) {
      print('Related: ${related.name}');
      // Display related products
    });
  }

} catch (e) {
  // Handle errors fetching product details
  print('Error fetching product with options: $e');
}
```

This approach significantly reduces the number of network requests compared to fetching each piece of related data separately.

#### Making Custom API Calls

While this package aims to cover the most common WooCommerce REST API endpoints, you might encounter scenarios where you need to:

1.  Call an endpoint not yet implemented by this package.
2.  Interact with custom endpoints added by other WooCommerce plugins.

For these cases, the package exposes the configured `Dio` instance directly via `woocommerce.dio`. This allows you to make arbitrary HTTP requests to your WooCommerce site, leveraging the base URL, authentication headers, and logging interceptor already set up by the `WooCommerce` class.

**Example:**

Let's say you need to fetch data from a custom endpoint `/wp-json/my-custom-plugin/v1/data` added by another plugin.

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart'; // Import Dio

// Assuming 'woocommerce' is your initialized WooCommerce instance.

final customEndpoint = '/my-custom-plugin/v1/data'; // Relative path to the custom endpoint

try {
  // Use the exposed dio instance for the custom GET request
  final response = await woocommerce.dio.get(
    customEndpoint,
    queryParameters: {
      'filter': 'some_value', // Add any necessary query parameters
      'limit': 5,
    },
  );

  // Check if the request was successful (status code 2xx)
  if (response.statusCode! >= 200 && response.statusCode! < 300) {
    // Process the response data (likely a Map or List)
    print('Custom API Response: ${response.data}');
    // You might need to parse response.data into your custom Dart models
  } else {
    // Handle non-successful status codes
    print('Custom API request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
    print('Response body: ${response.data}');
  }

} on DioException catch (e) {
  // Handle Dio-specific errors (network issues, timeouts, etc.)
  print('Dio error calling custom endpoint $customEndpoint: $e');
  if (e.response != null) {
    // The server responded with an error status code
    print('Error response data: ${e.response?.data}');
  } else {
    // Error setting up or sending the request
    print('Error message: ${e.message}');
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Handle any other unexpected errors
  print('Unexpected error calling custom endpoint $customEndpoint: $e');
}
```

Using `woocommerce.dio` gives you the flexibility to interact with any part of the WooCommerce REST API (or related custom APIs) directly, while still benefiting from the package's setup for authentication and base URL configuration. Remember to consult the WooCommerce REST API documentation or the documentation of the specific plugin for details on available endpoints, parameters, and expected response formats.
